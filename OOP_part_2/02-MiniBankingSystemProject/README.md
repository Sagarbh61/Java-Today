**Mini Banking Project – Java OOP**

This project is a simple console-based banking application built in Java, designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, classes, methods, and access modifiers.

It is a menu-driven project that allows users to simulate banking operations in a small-scale environment.

**Features**

1. PIN-based Authentication

2. Users must enter a correct PIN to access their account.

3. After 3 invalid attempts, the account is locked.

**Account Operations**

1. View Balance – Check the current account balance.

2. Deposit – Add money to the account.

3. Withdraw – Withdraw money if sufficient balance exists.

4. Exit – Quit the application safely.

**Encapsulation**

1. Sensitive data (PIN, balance) is private.

2. Access is controlled using getter and setter methods.

3. Demonstrates read-only, write-only, and read-write fields.

4. Menu-Driven System

5. Uses loops and switch-case for user interaction.

6. Displays options clearly and handles invalid input gracefully.
