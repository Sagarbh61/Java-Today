## Encapsulation Programs

This folder contains Java programs demonstrating encapsulation:

1. Basic encapsulation using private variables and public getters/setters
2. Read-only encapsulation (getter only)
3. Write-only encapsulation (setter only)

Encapsulation ensures data security, controlled access, and clean object-oriented design.
