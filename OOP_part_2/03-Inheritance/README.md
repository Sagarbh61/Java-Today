**Java OOP – Inheritance Examples**

This folder contains example programs demonstrating inheritance in Java. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (superclass). These examples cover single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.

1. Single Inheritance

Program: InheritanceExample.java

Description:
Demonstrates a single inheritance relationship where Dog inherits from Animal.
The subclass (Dog) can access fields and methods from the superclass (Animal) and also define its own methods.

Key points:

Shows how a subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of a superclass.

Example of single inheritance (one subclass, one superclass).

2. Multilevel Inheritance

Program: MultilevelInheritanceExample.java

Description:
Demonstrates multilevel inheritance where GrandChild inherits from Child, and Child inherits from Parent.

Key points:

Illustrates how properties and methods are inherited through multiple levels.

Useful for understanding deep hierarchies in OOP.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance

Program: HierarchicalInheritanceExample.java

Description:
Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance, where multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.
For example, Dog and Cat both inherit from Animal.

Key points:

Shows different classes sharing common behavior from a parent class.

Highlights the reuse of common code in multiple subclasses.
